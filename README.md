# Extensions

Just trying to make web browser extensions

## 1. OnePopup: [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/onepopup/)   [Chrome](#)

* This is a cross browser extension
* This will display all the tabs that are open in the browser, grouped based on the window they're open in, and displayed the form of a list
* The active tab of each window will be highlighted
* This also displays the last time you accessed a specific tab (Firefox only)
* Every link has a button next to it which will convert that link into a QR Code. This code can be scanned by any individual and the active website will open up in the phone
* Feature in mind: Highlight the tabs that haven't been opened in over 5 days so that the user can close them to declutter and save memory
