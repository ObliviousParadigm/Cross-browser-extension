# Extensions

Just trying to make web browser extensions

## 1. OnePopup

* This is an extension for Firefox
* This will all the tabs that are open in the browser grouped based on the window they're open in and displayed the form of a list
* The active tab of each window will be highlighted
* Every link has a button next to it which will convert that link into a QR Code. This code can be scanned by any individual and the active website will open up in the phone

### Load the extension in Firefox

1. Open Firefox browser and navigate to `about:debugging` 
2. Click "Load Temporary Add-on" and from the file browser, choose `Extensions/OnePopup/manifest.json`
